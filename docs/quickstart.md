## Quickstart

The workflow uses [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to manage compute and 
software resources, as such nextflow will need to be installed before attempting
to run the workflow.

The workflow can currently be run using either
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or
[Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) to provide isolation of
the required software. Both methods are automated out-of-the-box provided
either Docker or Singularity is installed.

It is not required to clone or download the git repository in order to run the workflow.

**Workflow options**

To obtain the workflow, having installed `nextflow`, users can run:

```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-bacterial-genomes --help
```

to see the options for the workflow.

**Workflow outputs**

The primary outputs of the workflow include:

* a [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA) consensus sequence scaffolded from a provided reference sequence,
* a [VCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format) file containing variants in the sample compared to the reference (if provided),
* an HTML report document detailing QC metrics and the primary findings of the workflow,
* (optionally) an annotation of the consensus sequence using prokka.
* (optionally) a per-sample ResFinder output directory with various results.
