# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [unreleased]
### Changed
- Reconciled workflow with wf-template v5.5.0.
- Increasing memory retries for flye deNovo process
### Fixed
- `makeReport` process used to fail with unaligned (u)BAMs as input because unaligned bams were excluded by default by `xam_ingress`. We fixed this by setting `xam_ingress` to keep the unaligned files as well.

## [v1.4.1]
### Added
- `Flye` stats output and report
### Changed
- Reconciled workflow with wf-template v5.3.0
- Filtering samples with no data on meta.n_seqs instead of presence of fastq file post ingress

## [v1.4.0]
### Changed
- Reconciled workflow with wf-template v5.2.5.
- Report wording.
- Updated Medaka to v2.0.0.

## [v1.3.0]
### Added
- Workflow now accepts BAM as well as FASTQ files as input (using the `--bam` or `--fastq` parameters, respectively)
- `--override_basecaller_cfg` parameter for cases where automatic basecall model detection fails or users wish to override the automatic choice.
### Removed
- The `--basecaller_cfg`, `--medaka_consensus_model`, and `--medaka_variant_model` parameters as the appropriate Medaka model is now automatically determined from the input data.
### Changed
- New docker images for [resfinder](https://hub.docker.com/r/ontresearch/resfinder) and [mlst](https://hub.docker.com/r/ontresearch/mlst).

## [v1.2.0]
### Added
- `client_fields` parameter to allow input of a JSON file of key value pairs to display on output reports.
- `min_read_length` parameter to remove reads below specified length (default 1000bp) from downstream analysis, to improve de novo assembly process
- Salmonella serotyping with `SeqSero2`

### Fixed
- Duplicate entries in `Pointfinder` processing

## [v1.1.1]
### Fixed
- Report generation when `Resfinder` fails

## [v1.1.0]
### Added
- Sample results aggregated into `results.json`

### Changed
- De novo assembly mode uses `--nano-hq` rather than `--nano-raw`
- Some formatting in github issue template.
- Retry and memory bump if de novo assembly fails first time

### Fixed
- Workflow now runs to completion when a sample fails the de novo assembly
- The workflow requesting too little memory for some processes.
