# Bacterial genomes Workflow

This repository contains a [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow 
for analysing bacterial genomes. 



# Introduction

If no reference is included assembly will be 
completed using [flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye) and polished with 
[medaka](https://www.github.com/nanoporetech/medaka). If a reference is provided
alignment will be done with [mini_align](https://github.com/nanoporetech/pomoxis/blob/master/scripts/mini_align)
and variant called using medaka. The workflow has a few optional extras. It can run
[prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka) to annotate the resulting
consensus sequence or [ResFinder](https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/resfinder/src/master/) to check it against a database of antimicrobial resistance genes.




## Quickstart

The workflow uses [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to manage compute and 
software resources, as such nextflow will need to be installed before attempting
to run the workflow.

The workflow can currently be run using either
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or
[Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) to provide isolation of
the required software. Both methods are automated out-of-the-box provided
either Docker or Singularity is installed.

It is not required to clone or download the git repository in order to run the workflow.

**Workflow options**

To obtain the workflow, having installed `nextflow`, users can run:

```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-bacterial-genomes --help
```

to see the options for the workflow.

**Workflow outputs**

The primary outputs of the workflow include:

* a [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA) consensus sequence scaffolded from a provided reference sequence,
* a [VCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format) file containing variants in the sample compared to the reference (if provided),
* an HTML report document detailing QC metrics and the primary findings of the workflow,
* (optionally) an annotation of the consensus sequence using prokka.
* (optionally) a per-sample ResFinder output directory with various results.
